                        I am a passionate developer who focuses their studies in
                        computer graphics programming. It is the grand scope and
                        challenge that drives me forward in understanding how to 
                        give graphical life to a digital space. I enjoy developing
                        systems that help break down large problems into manageable 
                        and flexible pieces. This way of thinking leads me 
                        to studying effective code architectures in order to foster healthy
                        code bases that remain extendable and maintainable. <br><br>

                        When I am not studying I can be found mountain biking, reading, writing, or
                        playing video games with my significant other. A few of my favorite novels
                        at the moment are: The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb, Ship of Magic by Robin Hobb,
                        The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson, Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky,
                        and The Expanse by James S.A Corey. <br><br>

                        above tabs, <strong>Projects</strong> and <strong>Articles</strong>. <br><br>

                        Take care and happy coding.
