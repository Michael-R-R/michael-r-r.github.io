            <p>
                This is my main project. It is the one I dedicate most of my time to when I have the spare time.
                It has seen quite a few overhauls and rewrites over time, as I become more experienced. What I love most
                about this project is just how much it has taught me and helped me grow. It it constantly 
                requiring me to improve my skills in order to tackle any giving task I am working on and I wouldn't
                trade it for the world. <br><br>

                Many, many days ago, when I was first exploring the endless pit of programming I became enthralled to the wonders
                of computer graphics. It started out with me exploring game engines already out on shelves such as, Unreal
                and Unity. I had a lot of fun just messing around and learning about each of them but, I always
                found myself wondering how it all came together as a complete package. How does the scripting work in Unity?
                How does Unreal render its scenes? It was the root of those types of questions when I decided to branch out and begin to
                research such things. I wanted to learn, but more importantly, I wanted to get hands on experience with
                developing such a software. <br><br>

                It was an ambitious undertaking. Still is. But, looking back it has helped me develop my skills so much.
                It opened the doors to studying programming patterns, programming languages, flexible architecture designs,
                and a general sense of style. No matter how ambitious the task is - for real, an entire game engine, plus
                editor - no matter how many mistakes I make, I will keep going forward and chipping away at it, because 
                at the end of the day I just enjoy it too much. <br><br>

                So, don't be surprised if you don't see a update for a while upon this project. It takes me time. I am only
                a single person and I have to take care of real life responsibilities too. At this point though I am beginning
                to find a nice ebb and flow to my work flow and going forward from here we should start seeing some more
                interesting features from this project. <br><br>

                With all that said, I hope you enjoy. Take care and happy coding. <br><br>

            <h1>C# Iguana Eye (prototype)</h1>
            <h2>Discuss</h2>
            <p>
                This is the prototype version of the C++ Iguana Eye engine. It utilizes C#, OpenTK, and Imgui. I chose
                to have a separate version because I find it much faster to write up and test things using C#, compared
                to C++, for reasons that may be obvious to those that have experience in both languages. <br><br>

                For the most part if a feature resides in C++ Iguana Eye, then it also resides in this prototype version.
