                This project is the second of a video tutorial series called, "Applying What You've Learned."
                It was planned and designed for students of Arizona State University's course CSE 240,
                Introduction to Programming Languages. Its main focus is on inheritance and polymorphism. <br><br>

                The project utilizes C++ and the Qt framework. It is a rudimentary board game, where two players
                take back to back turns commanding their pieces of three separate classes: ranger, rouge, and 
                barbarian. <br><br>

                As mentioned above this tutorial goes into detail and practices in order to leverage good 
                inheritance design to best maximize the power of polymorphism. We start with a base class for 
                board pieces and build upon our foundation, taking advantage of inheritance to apply the 
                principle of DRY (don't repeat yourself). <br><br>
