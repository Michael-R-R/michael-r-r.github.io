                For the past few weeks I have been working on improving and implementing more 
                functionality to my Entity-Component-System. Things are really beginning to 
                shape up and come together into a entire package. In this update we will be taking 
                a look at my ECS implementation and we will have a look at a cube entity creation 
                performance stress test. Let us start with the ECS first. <br><br>

                The entire purpose of undergoing the pursuit of a ECS was because I wanted to have the 
                ability to have more flexible game objects. I had found that class inheritance was a 
                busy mess and would only get worse the more things I needed to develop. With a ECS I 
                now have better capabilities of defining what exactly entails a game object or in other 
                terms a entity. <br><br>

                Let us examine a cube entity and what components make it up. At the moment there are 
                six components that define what a cube entity is. They are as follows: name; transform; 
                mesh; shader; material; and renderable. See the following image below. <br><br>

                The great part about using a ECS is that this current cube entity doesn’t have to remain 
                as a cube entity. For example if we wanted to attach a new mesh to this entity then we 
                simply just select a new mesh from the drop down menu and we now have an entire new 
                looking entity, such as a plane/quad entity. The components are what define what an 
                entity is and this allows for any combination of entities to be created without crazy 
                inheritance trees or super classes. <br><br>

                With the understanding of how we can leverage the flexibility of a ECS, let us shift our 
                focus to the system side of things and talk about a couple design choices I have made. <br><br>

                One important part to developing a game engine is speed. We should always be conscious 
                about performance and memory usage. One way I approached memory usage issues is reusing 
                assets that have already been created. For instance, if we already have a dragon mesh 
                that has been loaded into memory and we want to create another entity that utilizes the 
                same mesh then it only makes sense that we share that mesh asset between the two entities 
                instead of re-allocating an entire other dragon mesh. We could have 1,000 entities 
                that use the dragon meshes in the scene, but only one mesh object need be allocated 
                in memory. <br><br>

                For performance I mentioned I utilize instance rendering, which brought with it, its own 
                complications. The limitation about instance rendering is that everything that is going 
                to be drawn has to be the exact same. For example if I have a cube and a quad we would 
                need two draw calls because they have different meshes. A cube instance renderable cannot 
                instance draw a quad and vice versa. Another consideration we have to think about is the 
                shader being used by each instance draw call. Say we have a cube that uses Blue_Shader 
                and another cube that uses Red_Shader. This will require two draw calls as well because
                when it comes time to do a instance draw call, we are drawing all of those meshes at once 
                with the currently bound shader. So, with that said a renderable object needs to worry 
                about two things: does it have the same mesh and does it have the same shader? If you can 
                answer yes to both of those questions then you can utilize instancing. <br><br>

                Those two previously mentioned limitations are what helped me design my rendering 
                pipeline in order to achieve better performance. We know that each renderable object 
                needs to have the same mesh and shader in order to qualify for instancing. What the 
                system will do for us then is when a user switches a mesh and/or shader it will do a 
                look up to see if there is a renderable object that shares those two things. If a match 
                is found then we can utilize that renderable object to add a instance child to it. This 
                will then detach the entity from the old renderable and then attach it onto the new 
                renderable. If no matches were found then we simply just create a new renderable object 
                with the given mesh and shader. Another thing that is useful that feeds into the memory 
                usage is we garbage collect any renderable objects after detaching an entity from it. 
                After detaching, if the renderable object no longer has any instance children then we 
                can safely remove it from memory. <br><br>

                Let us now take a look at some stress tests for creating a cube entity. I wanted to 
                perform this in order to see how well the ECS performed with creating small and large 
                amounts of entities. For the test I utilized a stop watch in order to record the 
                time(ms) it takes to create the given amount of cube entities. The creation of the 
                cube entities takes place all in one go. So, if we create 10 cube entities then we 
                will loop through and create all ten before further moving forward. Each cube entity 
                was created with the following five components attached to it: transform; mesh; 
                material; shader; and renderable. <br><br>
