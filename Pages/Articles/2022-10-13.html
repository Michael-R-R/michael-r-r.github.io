            For the past few weeks I have been working on improving and implementing more 
            functionality to my Entity-Component-System. Things are really beginning to 
            shape up and come together into a entire package. In this update we will be taking 
            a look at my ECS implementation and we will have a look at a cube entity creation 
            performance stress test. Let us start with the ECS first. <br><br>

            The entire purpose of undergoing the pursuit of a ECS was because I wanted to have the 
            ability to have more flexible game objects. I had found that class inheritance was a 
            busy mess and would only get worse the more things I needed to develop. With a ECS I 
            now have better capabilities of defining what exactly entails a game object or in other 
            terms a entity. <br><br>

            Let us examine a cube entity and what components make it up. At the moment there are 
            six components that define what a cube entity is. They are as follows: name; transform; 
            mesh; shader; material; and renderable. See the following image below. <br><br>

            The great part about using a ECS is that this current cube entity doesnâ€™t have to remain 
            as a cube entity. For example if we wanted to attach a new mesh to this entity then we 
            simply just select a new mesh from the drop down menu and we now have an entire new 
            looking entity, such as a plane/quad entity. The components are what define what an 
            entity is and this allows for any combination of entities to be created without crazy 
            inheritance trees or super classes. <br><br>

            With the understanding of how we can leverage the flexibility of a ECS, let us shift our 
            focus to the system side of things and talk about a couple design choices I have made. <br><br>

            One important part to developing a game engine is speed. We should always be conscious 
            about performance and memory usage. One way I approached memory usage issues is reusing 
            assets that have already been created. For instance, if we already have a dragon mesh 
            that has been loaded into memory and we want to create another entity that utilizes the 
            same mesh then it only makes sense that we share that mesh asset between the two entities 
            instead of re-allocating an entire other dragon mesh. We could have 1,000 entities 
            that use the dragon meshes in the scene, but only one mesh object need be allocated 
            in memory. <br><br>

            For performance I mentioned I utilize instance rendering, which brought with it, its own 
            complications. The limitation about instance rendering is that everything that is going 
            to be drawn has to be the exact same. For example if I have a cube and a quad we would 
            need two draw calls because they have different meshes. A cube instance renderable cannot 
            instance draw a quad and vice versa. Another consideration we have to think about is the 
            shader being used by each instance draw call. Say we have a cube that uses Blue_Shader 
            and another cube that uses Red_Shader. This will require two draw calls as well because
            when it comes time to do a instance draw call, we are drawing all of those meshes at once 
            with the currently bound shader. So, with that said a renderable object needs to worry 
            about two things: does it have the same mesh and does it have the same shader? If you can 
            answer yes to both of those questions then you can utilize instancing. <br><br>

            Those two previously mentioned limitations are what helped me design my rendering 
            pipeline in order to achieve better performance. We know that each renderable object 
            needs to have the same mesh and shader in order to qualify for instancing. What the 
            system will do for us then is when a user switches a mesh and/or shader it will do a 
            look up to see if there is a renderable object that shares those two things. If a match 
            is found then we can utilize that renderable object to add a instance child to it. This 
            will then detach the entity from the old renderable and then attach it onto the new 
            renderable. If no matches were found then we simply just create a new renderable object 
            with the given mesh and shader. Another thing that is useful that feeds into the memory 
            usage is we garbage collect any renderable objects after detaching an entity from it. 
            After detaching, if the renderable object no longer has any instance children then we 
            can safely remove it from memory. <br><br>

            Let us now take a look at some stress tests for creating a cube entity. I wanted to 
            perform this in order to see how well the ECS performed with creating small and large 
            amounts of entities. For the test I utilized a stop watch in order to record the 
            time(ms) it takes to create the given amount of cube entities. The creation of the 
            cube entities takes place all in one go. So, if we create 10 cube entities then we 
            will loop through and create all ten before further moving forward. Each cube entity 
            was created with the following five components attached to it: transform; mesh; 
            material; shader; and renderable. <br><br>
