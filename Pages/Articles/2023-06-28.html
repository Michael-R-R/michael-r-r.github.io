            <p>
                C++ is an object-oriented programming language. When we think in terms of 
                object orientation one might think encapsulation and objects that handle and take care 
                of their own data. When that object gets created we can easily or at least it should be 
                easy to track the lifetime of that object and the data that it contains whether it is created 
                on the stack or the heap. With this idea in mind, we can begin to see why declaring 
                static member variables in your classes can be a dangerous act as long as we 
                understand what that static variable is doing. <br><br>

                Static member variables do not play by the same rules as the rest of your class’s 
                other member variables. Say for instance you create an object on the stack within a 
                local scope, change that static member variable's data, and then exit the scope in turn 
                destroying that object. No harm, no foul, right? Not quite. That static member variable 
                will outlive that object even though it has been destroyed. It doesn’t fear death like the 
                object because its lifetime spans from start up to shut down of the program. Essentially, 
                the static member variable belongs to the class and not the objects themselves. To give 
                a better understanding of what I am talking about let’s take a closer look with an 
                example. <br><br>

                Consider the following small class, Foo: <br>
                <strong>.h file</strong>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        #pragma once
                        class Foo
                        {
                            static int smallNumber;
                            int bigNumber;
                        public:
                            Foo();
                            ~Foo();
                            void loop(const unsigned amount);
                            int getSmallNumber() { return smallNumber; }
                            int getBigNumber() { return bigNumber; }
                        };
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
        </div>
