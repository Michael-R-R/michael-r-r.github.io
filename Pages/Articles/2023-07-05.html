                As of late I have been working on re-imagining what a renderable (things you see drawn to screen) is. 
                I wanted a more flexible (who doesn't?) class that makes it easier to work with any type of renderable we might need,
                meaning the buffers that make up that renderable and whether or not that renderable is instanceable. The latter being
                the most important part to handle, in my opinion, because a lot of the render engine is built to support a strong instancing pipeline
                in order to gain efficient frame times. <br><br>

                So, here in this quick update, is a demo of such a system implemented. A flexible renderable class that can be easily created
                to handle index based rendering, vertex based rendering, or instance version of both those rendering methods. The great
                thing is that even when you have hidden instance data for any given renderable, that data is still able to be serialized,
                and then deserialized without any loss of instances. <br><br>

                Below is the short demo of testing such an index-based instance renderable. It highlights the benefits of such system
                with fast instance creation, fast show/hide functionality, and the powerful serializing capabilities. <br><br>
            </p>

                In the video I first start off with creating our required resources that make up a renderable: mesh, material, and shader. Afterwards
                I demonstrate adding instances of that renderable, followed by a quick showcase of hiding and showing the instances. I then create 1000
                simple cube instances to demonstrate the quickness of batch instance creation. This is even quite fast for higher vertice count meshes,
                as well. Lastly, in the video, I demonstrate serializing all the hidden instances we have created thus far, I then clear the current 
                renderable by creating a new set of resources, and then deserialize the previous renderable, and then show all the hidden instances
                to prove that we have in fact successfully reacquired the serialized renderable. <br><br>
