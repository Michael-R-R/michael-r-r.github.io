                The foundational work has been laid for supporting Lua scripting. Scripting will range in support
                for automating editor functionality to applying behaviors onto entities. In this post we demonstrate
                writing a camera controller script. The scripting engine also supports basic type serialization and
                querying for external scripts attached to other entities and communicating with them. <br><br>

                I have also begone working on a simple prototype for implementing Physx into the engine. This will soon
                transition into its own in-game engine, as well as a supporting component for the ECS system in order to
                allow attaching static and dynamic physics with collisions onto entities. This will grant us the ability
                for object collisions, selection by ray cast, and trigger zones. <br><br>
