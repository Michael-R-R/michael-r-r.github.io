<p class="ul-item-preview-description">
    The foundational work has been laid for supporting Lua scripting. Scripting will range in support
    for automating editor functionality to applying behaviors onto entities. In this post we demonstrate
    writing a camera controller script. The scripting engine also supports basic type serialization and
    querying for external scripts attached to other entities and communicating with them. <br><br>

    I have also begone working on a simple prototype for implementing Physx into the engine. This will soon
    transition into its own in-game engine, as well as a supporting component for the ECS system in order to
    allow attaching static and dynamic physics with collisions onto entities. This will grant us the ability
    for object collisions, selection by ray cast, and trigger zones. <br><br>
